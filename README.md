Every folder in the `raw.data` folder corresponds to a day of data collection.

Legend for folder names can be found in `Img_Notes.xlsx`. This file also includes notes on the images themselves, especially relevent for the two outside days to define species, location, and notes (these are also the ones I recommend perusing because they're neat images).
  - `f2.outside`
  - `m1.reifel`
  
Corresponding clean script and data goes into correspondingly names folders in the `clean.data` folder.

Note: Complete or in progress custom functions can be found on the `main.R` file.
